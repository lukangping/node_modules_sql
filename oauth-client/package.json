There are currently a handful of OAuth libraries but I choose to take a different route with how the API is used.  The usage is really similar to [simplegeo's python OAuth client](http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2).  It extends the built-in http client which makes signing requests require two extra parameters.  The only difference is that requests must have thier body (if present) and a signature provided, the client takes care of the rest. You are responsible for handling the authentication flow, check out [this example](http://github.com/unscene/node-oauth/blob/master/examples/twitter.js) to see possible uses.\n\nThanks to [ciaranj](http://github.com/ciaranj/) for providing a place to \n[start](http://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth).\n\n# Installation\nYou can be fancy and clone the repo from here, or install [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm) and run:\n\n\tnpm install oauth-client\n\nThe include you must specify, if using the npm install:\n\n\trequire('oauth-client')\n\nOtherwise:\n\n\trequire('oauth')\n\n#Usage\n\nSee the twitter example for a three legged authentication example.\n\n## Creating a client\nCreating a client works exactly to the regular http client, it actually returns an subclassed http client.\n\n\tclient = oauth.createClient(443,'api.twitter.com,true)\n\n## Sending requests\nSending http requests is the only area that has a couple of differences from the built-in http module:\n\n\tvar headers = {\n\t\tsome-header: 'some value' \n\t}\n\t\n\tvar body = {\n\t\ta: 'b'\n\t}\n\t\n\treq = client.request('POST', '/request_token', headers, body, null)\n\treq.write(body);\n\treq.end();\n\nWe will talk about that last parameter in a minute.  With node you can stream the body and the only reason you must provide this up front is for the body to be included in the signature base string calculation, if you are sending a body of type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.  The body must be an object (it then gets converted into a properly encoded string).  There are a set of default headers included but you can override them by simply providing your own, your headers get merged into the defaults.  Be sure to include the same body as you specified in the request, this way you can still stream the body.\n\nYou can also specify your own oauth_* parameters in the query string:\n\n\treq = client.request('POST', '/request_token?oauth_callback=oob', headers, body, null)\n\nThese params get split out and included in the authorization header.\t\n\n## Signatures\n\nThat last parameter is the only portion that takes some setup.  This is the piece that calculates and signed your requests.  There are two types provided: Plaintext & HMAC-SHA1 (RSA in the future maybe)\n\n\tvar consumer = oauth.createConsumer('key','secret');\n\tvar signer = oauth.createHmac(consumer);\n\t..\n\t\n\tclient.request('POST', '/request_token', headers, body, signer);\n\nIf you have an authorized or unauthorized token you can provide that to the createHMAC constructor as well.\nYou just need to provide the type of signature you want along with the consumer and tokens, requests get automatically signed.\n\n## Consumers and Tokens\n\nConsumers and tokens both have a utility method decode() that will take an http response and collect the form encoded responses.\n\n\tvar data = ''\n\t\n\trequestToken.addListener('response', function (response) {\n\t\tresponse.addListener('data', function (chunk) {\tdata+=chunk });\n\t\tresponse.addListener('end', onRequestTokenResponse);\n\t});\n\n\tfunction onRequestTokenResponse() {\n\t\ttoken.decode(data);\n\t\t..\n\t}\n\n# Tests\nI am not sure the total code coverage of the tests at this point, but it is quickly getting there.Running the tests requires vows.
